    <h1>What gamemodes are in this game?</h1>
    <p>1. Slippery Showdown
        Players start with only banana blasters and must navigate a giant, slippery arena filled with banana peels. The goal is to knock opponents into slime pits while trying to stay upright yourself. The last player standing wins!</p>
    <p> 2. Dance Battle Royale
        Instead of traditional combat, players compete in dance-offs scattered throughout the map. Players must match prompts on-screen to out-dance their opponents. The last dancer standing (or grooving) earns a crown and a funky dance emote!</p>
    <p> 3. Food Fight Frenzy
        Every player is armed with a random assortment of food items. Players must throw food at each other while dodging flying pies and burgers. The more mess you create, the more points you earn. The player with the most points when the timer runs out is declared the winner!</p>
    <p> 4. Bubble Trouble
        Players ride bubble tricycles in a massive arena filled with obstacles and traps. The goal is to pop as many bubbles as possible while avoiding being knocked out of the arena by opponents. The player with the most pops at the end wins!</p>
    <p> 5. The Great Hat Heist
        Players must collect as many silly hats as possible within a time limit while avoiding opponents. Each hat has a unique effect (e.g., increased speed, temporary invisibility). The player with the most hats at the end wins!</p>
    <p> 6. Wacky Wild Goose Chase
        A twist on the classic chase game: one player is designated as "The Goose" and must evade the other players, who are trying to tag them. The Goose can throw silly distractions (like rubber chickens) to escape, and if tagged, the next player becomes the Goose!</p>
    <p> 7. Inflatable Mayhem
        Players are given inflatable weapons and must battle in an arena filled with inflatable structures. The catch? The structures can be inflated or deflated, changing the landscape mid-battle. Strategy is key to using the changing environment to your advantage!</p>
    <p> 8. Confetti Catastrophe
        Players must collect confetti scattered around the map while avoiding others trying to pop their confetti balloons. The more confetti you collect, the bigger your balloon gets. If it pops, you lose points! The player with the most confetti at the end wins!</p>
    <p> 9. Unicorn Derby
        Compete in a race on unicorn hoverboards through a zany course filled with obstacles, ramps, and shortcuts. Players can use power-ups to sabotage opponents or boost themselves. The first to cross the finish line wins a trophy!</p>
    <p> 10. Bouncing Bonanza
        A king-of-the-hill style mode where players must control a giant bouncy castle in the center of the map. Players bounce their way to victory while trying to knock others out of the castle. The longer you stay inside, the more points you earn!</p>
